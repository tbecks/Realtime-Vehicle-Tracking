# Realtime Vehicle Tracking

This solution is intended to simulate a vechicle tracking solution in real-time over a mapping applications.  Vehicle data consists of GPS coordinate data that is streamed into Azure and presented on a web application using Azure Maps.  

The solution will use the following services:
* Local Python script - to publish tracking coordinates
* Data files with vehicle tracking data
* IoT Hub
* Azure Functions
* SignalR
* App Service
* Azure Maps
* Power BI
